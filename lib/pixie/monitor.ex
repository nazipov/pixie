defmodule Pixie.Monitor do

  @moduledoc """
  Allows you to monitor various events within Pixie.

  Internally Pixie.Monitor is implemented using GenEvent, so you're free to
  bypass using the Pixie.Monitor behaviour and use your own GenEvent if the
  need arises.

  Usage example:
  ```elixir
  defmodule MyMonitor do
    use Pixie.Monitor

    def created_channel channel_name, at do
      Logger.info "Channel \#\{channel_name} created at \#\{format at}"
    end

    def destroyed_channel channel_name, at do
      Logger.info "Channel \#\{channel_name} destroyed at \#\{format at}"
    end

    defp format timestamp do
      timestamp
        |> Date.from(:timestamp)
        |> DateFormat.format!("{UNIX}")
    end
  end
  ```
